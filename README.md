### Notes
- I updated my Auto Layout constraints to be more precise and added new Auto Layout constraints for the grid layout. The app works well for different devices and in different orientations.  
- I was able to make the same movie details screen for the superhero movies. Both details screens (the one for the general movies and the one for the superhero movies) have an identical layout for neatness.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- For the bonus portion of the assignment, I had some trouble with Auto Layout at first--adding layout constraints on the items within the table cell in the storyboard was giving me some difficulties and gave me quite a few errors at first. Eventually I was able to get my app to where it is now and get rid of all of the Auto Layout erros, and I am happy with it. Despite this, I want to do more research about Auto Layout for more complex apps that we will be building in the future.
